# AmigaROMUtil
A utility for splitting, merging, encrypting, decrypting, byte swapping/unswapping, and checksumming Amiga Kickstart ROMs with a database of known ROMs

This is intended to be both a standalone application as well as a set of files (everything but main.c and the Makefile) which can easily be used in other applications in order to easily provide similar functionality.

To build, just run `make`.
