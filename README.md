# AmigaROMUtil
A utility for splitting, merging, encrypting, decrypting, byte swapping/unswapping, and checksumming Amiga Kickstart ROMs with a database of known ROMs

This is intended to be both a standalone application as well as a set of files (everything but main.c and the Makefile) which can easily be used in other applications in order to easily provide similar functionality.

For the known ROMs, I pulled the ones from my copy of Amiga Forever 9, but I'm sure there are quite a few I'm missing as a result.  Any additions or corrections to that data would be very welcome.

To build, just run `make`.
